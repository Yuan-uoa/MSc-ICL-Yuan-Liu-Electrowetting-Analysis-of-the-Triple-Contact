\chapter{Droplet Shapes in Two Scenarios}
\hspace{0em}\indent The complex potential of the distant slit provides the surface charge density, leading to a method for geometrically magnifying the distant view and restoring the droplet's height as an analytic function. Subsequently, the validity of the complex potential is tested to determine whether the derived droplet curves exhibit properties similar to those observed in experiments.
