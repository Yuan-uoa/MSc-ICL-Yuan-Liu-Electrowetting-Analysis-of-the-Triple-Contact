abstract = {A one parameter family of analytical solutions for the equilibrium shapes of two-dimensional charged conducting droplets on a substrate with 90° contact angle is presented. The solutions exhibit the tendency to dewet at the droplet centre as the electrostatic stress increases. Such electrostatic deformations are believed to underlie the recently observed stick-slip dynamics of nanodroplets on substrates. Our theoretical results complement a number of other recent analytical and numerical studies of this phenomenon.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of drops of a very viscous and conducting fluid under the influence of an external electric field. The drops may be neutral or may be charged with some amount of electric charge. If both the external electric field and total drop charge are sufficiently small, then prolate spherical shapes develop according to Taylor’s observations. For sufficiently large charge and/or external field a self-similar conelike singularity develops in a mechanism different from Taylor’s prediction. The opening semiangle of the cones both for uncharged and charged drops in a constant electric field is typically around
30
°
with a very slight dependence on the viscosity ratio and independence from both total charge and external field. We also discuss the structure of electric and velocity fields near the tip.},

abstract = {More than one century ago, Lippmann found that capillary forces can be effectively controlled by external electrostatic forces. As a simple example, by applying a voltage between a conducting liquid droplet and the surface it is sitting on we are able to adjust the wetting angle of the drop. Since Lippmann's findings, electrocapillary phenomena – or electrowetting – have developed into a series of tools for manipulating microdroplets on solid surfaces, or small amounts of liquids in capillaries for microfluidic applications. In this article, we briefly review some recent progress of fundamental understanding of electrowetting and address some still unsolved issues. Specifically, we focus on static and dynamic electrowetting. In static electrowetting, we discuss some basic phenomena found in DC and AC electrowetting, and some theories about the origin of contact angle saturation. In dynamic electrowetting, we introduce some studies about this rather recent area. At last, we address some other capillary phenomena governed by electrostatics and we give an outlook that might stimulate further investigations on electrowetting.

abstract = {This article attempts to elucidate the underlying mathematical connection between the well‐known exact solutions for the deep water capillary wave problem [G.D. Crapper, J. Fluid Mech., 2:532–540 (1957)] and the recent discovery of a very special polar decomposition of solutions for a steadily translating bubble with surface tension [S. Tanveer, Proc.Roy. Soc. A, 452:1397–1410 (1996)]. This is achieved by describing a new and unified mathematical approach to the two separate physical problems. Using the new approach, Crapper's capillary wave solutions are retrieved in a novel and simplified fashion, while additional analytical insight into the nature of solutions for a steadily‐translating bubble is obtained. The new approach is quite general and can also be used to obtain new exact results to other related free surface problems.},

abstract = {In this paper simple two-dimensional mathematical models for understanding the fluid dynamical problem of how circulation affects the free surface shapes of inviscid drops and bubbles with surface tension are presented. This theoretical paradigm is of interest in many areas of science including large-scale transport processes in chemical engineering. Exact solutions for the finite-amplitude steady-state equilibria of the mathematical models are found. Equilibrium states are shown to exist right up to steady capillary pinch-off in the case of a bubble, the bubbles just before pinch-off having large perimeter-to-area ratios.},

abstract = {We investigate the cyclical stick-slip motion of water nanodroplets on a hydrophilic substrate viewed with and stimulated by a transmission electron microscope. Using a continuum long wave theory, we show how the electrostatic stress imposed by non-uniform charge distribution causes a pinned convex drop to deform into a toroidal shape, with the shape characterized by the competition between the electrostatic stress and the surface tension of the drop, as well as the charge density distribution which follows a Poisson equation. A horizontal gradient in the charge density creates a lateral driving force, which when sufficiently large, overcomes the pinning induced by surface heterogeneities in the substrate disjoining pressure, causing the drop to slide on the substrate via a cyclical stick-slip motion. Our model predicts step-like dynamics in drop displacement and surface area jumps, qualitatively consistent with experimental observations.},

@article{Fontelos2008,
abstract = {We study the static shape of charged drops of a conducting fluid placed over a solid substrate, surrounded by a gas, and in absence of gravitational forces. The question can be formulated as a variational problem where a certain energy involving the areas of the solid-liquid interface and of the liquid-gas interface, as well as the electric capacity of the drop, has to be minimized. As a function of two parameters, Young's angle $\theta _y $ and the potential at the drop's surface V⁰, we find the axisymmetric minimizers of the energy and describe their shape. We also discuss the existence of symmetry-breaking bifurcations such that, for given values of $\theta _y $ and V⁰, configurations for which the axial symmetry is lost are energetically more favorable than axially symmetric configurations. We prove the existence of such bifurcations in the limits of very flat and almost spherical equilibrium shapes. All other cases are studied numerically with a boundary integral method. One conclusion of this study is that axisymmetric drops cannot spread indefinitely by introducing sufficient amount of electric charges, but can reach only a limiting (saturation) size, after which the axial symmetry would be lost and finger- like shapes energetically preferred.},

@article{MugeleF2007,
abstract = {Electrowetting is becoming a more and more frequently used tool to manipulate liquids in various microfluidic applications. On the scale of the entire drop, the effect of electrowetting is to reduce the apparent contact angle of partially wetting conductive liquids upon application of an external voltage. Microscopically, however, strong electric fields in the vicinity of the three phase contact line give rise to local deformations of the drop surface. We determined the equilibrium surface profile using a combined numerical, analytical, and experimental approach. We find that the local contact angle in electrowetting is equal to Young's angle independent of the applied voltage. Only on the scale of the thickness of the insulator and beyond does the surface slope assume a value consistent with the voltage-dependent apparent contact angle. This behaviour is verified experimentally by determining equilibrium surface profiles for insulators of various thicknesses between 10 and 250 mum. Numerically and analytically, we find that the local surface curvature diverges algebraically upon approaching the contact line with an exponent -1 < mu < 0. We discuss the relevance of the local surface properties for dynamic aspects of the contact line motion.},
