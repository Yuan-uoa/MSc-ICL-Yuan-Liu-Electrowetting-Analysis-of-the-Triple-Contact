abstract = {A one parameter family of analytical solutions for the equilibrium shapes of two-dimensional charged conducting droplets on a substrate with 90° contact angle is presented. The solutions exhibit the tendency to dewet at the droplet centre as the electrostatic stress increases. Such electrostatic deformations are believed to underlie the recently observed stick-slip dynamics of nanodroplets on substrates. Our theoretical results complement a number of other recent analytical and numerical studies of this phenomenon.},

abstract = {We study the static shape of charged drops of a conducting fluid placed over a solid substrate, surrounded by a gas, and in absence of gravitational forces. The question can be formulated as a variational problem where a certain energy involving the areas of the solid-liquid interface and of the liquid-gas interface, as well as the electric capacity of the drop, has to be minimized. As a function of two parameters, Young's angle $\theta _y $ and the potential at the drop's surface V⁰, we find the axisymmetric minimizers of the energy and describe their shape. We also discuss the existence of symmetry-breaking bifurcations such that, for given values of $\theta _y $ and V⁰, configurations for which the axial symmetry is lost are energetically more favorable than axially symmetric configurations. We prove the existence of such bifurcations in the limits of very flat and almost spherical equilibrium shapes. All other cases are studied numerically with a boundary integral method. One conclusion of this study is that axisymmetric drops cannot spread indefinitely by introducing sufficient amount of electric charges, but can reach only a limiting (saturation) size, after which the axial symmetry would be lost and finger- like shapes energetically preferred.},

abstract = {More than one century ago, Lippmann found that capillary forces can be effectively controlled by external electrostatic forces. As a simple example, by applying a voltage between a conducting liquid droplet and the surface it is sitting on we are able to adjust the wetting angle of the drop. Since Lippmann's findings, electrocapillary phenomena – or electrowetting – have developed into a series of tools for manipulating microdroplets on solid surfaces, or small amounts of liquids in capillaries for microfluidic applications. In this article, we briefly review some recent progress of fundamental understanding of electrowetting and address some still unsolved issues. Specifically, we focus on static and dynamic electrowetting. In static electrowetting, we discuss some basic phenomena found in DC and AC electrowetting, and some theories about the origin of contact angle saturation. In dynamic electrowetting, we introduce some studies about this rather recent area. At last, we address some other capillary phenomena governed by electrostatics and we give an outlook that might stimulate further investigations on electrowetting.

Using a continuum long wave theory, we show how the electrostatic stress imposed by non-uniform charge distribution causes a pinned convex drop to deform into a toroidal shape, with the shape characterized by the competition between the electrostatic stress and the surface tension of the drop, as well as the charge density distribution which follows a Poisson equation. A horizontal gradient in the charge density creates a lateral driving force, which when sufficiently large, overcomes the pinning induced by surface heterogeneities in the substrate disjoining pressure, causing the drop to slide on the substrate via a cyclical stick-slip motion. Our model predicts step-like dynamics in drop displacement and surface area jumps, qualitatively consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {This study is focusing on the durability of fluoropolymer hydrophobic coatings against falling droplets. Devices such as smart self-cleaning lens or droplet-based energy generators are open-air electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) devices, which are applications that utilize falling droplets. Therefore, the hydrophobic coatings of these devices are exposed to environment factors such as raindrop, and it is necessary to examine the durability of hydrophobic coatings in similar environments and the effectiveness of recovery. Thus, in this study, we simulate raindrops to damage samples with various thicknesses of Cytop (CTX-809SP2). Subsequently, damaged samples are heated to recover their hydrophobicity, and we repeat this damage-recovery cycle several times to evaluate the long-term durability of hydrophobic coating. The EWOD samples of three different hydrophobic coating thicknesses (0.1 μm, 0.5 μm, and 1.0 μm) are damaged by falling droplets from a certain height for 10 days. The damaged samples are then recovered by heating them on a hot plate at 200 ℃ for 24 h and evaluate their EWOD performance. In addition, the hydrophobic coatings are repeatedly damaged and recovered several times to examine the number of recovery limitations of the coatings. After the second damage-recovery cycle, the thickest hydrophobic coating sample shows 7 % better EWOD performance than others. Additionally, after the third damage-recovery cycle, the EWOD performance of all samples significantly degrade, experimentally verifying the number of recovery limitations of the hydrophobic coating. The results of this study are expected to provide useful information for open-air EWOD devices on the methods for evaluating their durability and the thickness selection of hydrophobic coating.},

abstract = {Electrowetting is becoming a more and more frequently used tool to manipulate liquids in various microfluidic applications. On the scale of the entire drop, the effect of electrowetting is to reduce the apparent contact angle of partially wetting conductive liquids upon application of an external voltage. Microscopically, however, strong electric fields in the vicinity of the three phase contact line give rise to local deformations of the drop surface. We determined the equilibrium surface profile using a combined numerical, analytical, and experimental approach. We find that the local contact angle in electrowetting is equal to Young's angle independent of the applied voltage. Only on the scale of the thickness of the insulator and beyond does the surface slope assume a value consistent with the voltage-dependent apparent contact angle. This behaviour is verified experimentally by determining equilibrium surface profiles for insulators of various thicknesses between 10 and 250 mum. Numerically and analytically, we find that the local surface curvature diverges algebraically upon approaching the contact line with an exponent -1 < mu < 0. We discuss the relevance of the local surface properties for dynamic aspects of the contact line motion.},

We derive a scaling law for the energy harvested by such "nanogenerators" and find that optimum efficiency is achieved by matching the timescales of the external electrical energy harvesting circuit and the hydrodynamic spreading process.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new type of switchable liquid shutter for the security and design of mobile electronic devices. The operation test of the liquid shutter is conducted using a prototype sample prepared by standard microfabrication processes. The liquid shutter consists of an opaque liquid for absorbing light and a transparent oil for transmitting light on two parallel plates with patterned indium titanium oxide electrodes. The liquid shutter can be opened and closed by sequentially applying an electrical voltage to the patterned electrodes owing to an electrowetting principle. The switching time of the liquid shutter is measured using a high-speed camera and is found to take about 550 ms to open the shutter and 240 ms to close the shutter at 70 Vrms (1 kHz). To validate the applicability of the liquid shutter, the operation of liquid shutters with different colored liquids mounted on a smartphone is successfully demonstrated. The proposed liquid shutter not only allows a simple design to be easily miniaturized and integrated with electronic devices but also provides a robust and fast switching operation.},

Based on these results, we first propose a smart self-cleaning lens cover for miniature cameras assisted by EW with transparent coplanar electrodes. This design has technological advantages, such as a rapid cleaning operation, effective energy consumption, and efficient integration into any device.},

Determining the stability limit of a droplet exposed to an external electric field has been a long-standing mathematical challenge, and the only analytical treatment to date is an approximate calculation for the particular case of a free-floating droplet. Here we demonstrate, experimentally and theoretically, that the stability limit of a conducting droplet or bubble exposed to an external electric field is described by a power law with broad generality that, in practice, applies to the cases in which the droplet or bubble is pinned or sliding on a conducting surface or free floating. This power law can facilitate the design of devices for liquid manipulation via a simple formula that captures the parameter range of bubbles and droplets that can be supported on electrified surfaces.},

abstract = {It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em­ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci­dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi­losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer­cury, it is about 140°, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean.},

abstract = {Electrowetting is the phenomenon of contact angle decrease under the influence of an external voltage applied across the solid/liquid interface. Electrowetting offers an interesting possibility to enhance the wettability of hydrophobic materials without altering the chemical composition of the system and thus could be incorporated in various microfluidic devices. Electrowetting is fundamentally an electrocapillary effect occurring on an insulated solid electrode (hence the change of the solid/liquid interfacial tension with voltage follows Lippmann's equation). A limiting contact angle value larger than zero is achieved even at very large external voltages. Saturation precludes full wetting of the substrate and restricts the magnitude of the capillary force variation. Contact angle saturation has been given various interpretations (e.g., charge trapping, air ionization) but appears to reflect a natural thermodynamic limit rather than being simply a defective property. The limiting value of the contact angle is given by the Young equation when the value of the solid/liquid interfacial tension reaches zero. The model is in excellent agreement with our own results and often gives an adequate description of published data. It also suggests that the saturation limit is determined by the material properties of the system and electrowetting at voltages exceeding this threshold is essentially a nonequilibrium process.},

abstract = {The disintegration of drops in strong electric fields is believed to play an important part in the formation of thunderstorms,
at least in those parts of them where no ice crystals are present. Zeleny showed experimentally that disintegration begins
as a hydrodynamical instability, but his ideas about the mechanics of the situation rest on the implicit assumption that instability
occurs when the internal pressure is the same as that outside the drop. It is shown that this assumption is false and that
instability of an elongated drop would not occur unless a pressure difference existed. When this error is corrected it is
found that a drop, elongated by an electric field, becomes unstable when its length is 1.9 times its equatorial diameter,
and the calculated critical electric field agrees with laboratory experiments to within 1%. When the drop becomes unstable
the ends develop obtuse-angled conical points from which axial jets are projected but the stability calculations give no indication
of the mechanics of this process. It is shown theoretically that a conical interface between two fluids can exist in equilibrium
in an electric field, but only when the cone has a semi-vertical angle 49.3$^\circ$. Apparatus was constructed for producing
the necessary field, and photographs show that conical oil/water interfaces and soap films can be produced at the caloulated
voltage and that their semi-vertical angles are very close to 49.3$^\circ$. The photographs give an indication of how the
axial jets are produced but no complete analytical description of the process is attempted.},
