\chapter{Potentials of 0$\degree$ Contact Angle Droplets}
\hspace{0em}\indent My supervisor envisions that the local properties of droplets can be revealed within a charge distribution model, which has a geometric scaling similarity to distant droplets. This chapter follows his framework, develops electric potentials for several cases, applies conformal mapping techniques and establishes the non-obvious complex potential of the conducting thin film.

Additionally, it should be noted that the derived functions in this chapter are inconsistent with similar models in \citet{Griffiths_2017} and have been incorporated into more complex scenarios.
