\section{Summary}
    \hspace{0em}\indent This chapter discusses the boundary conditions for the electrodes, dielectric, and droplet problem, scaling it down to a thin film problem and further simplifying it to solve the Laplace and Poisson equations for the point charge and disc embedded in a dielectric. Subsequently, two models are established: one for the charged disc embedded in a dielectric and the another for a point charge embedded in a dielectric. 
    
    The shielding effect of the dielectric is derived, and conformal mapping methods are used to analyse the induced charge positions in a dielectric with specific symmetry. Based on these models and the conformal mapping technique, the complex potential for the charge, dielectric, and conductive slit is obtained, which also describes a distant conducting droplet in a point charge's electric field.
    
    In the process, complex analysis tools simplify the boundary conditions and the calculations of the electric field, aiding in the identification of induced charges. Whereas, when a dielectric is present, Gauss's Law at the dielectric boundary requires the use of electric field equations to determine the magnitude of the charge.
