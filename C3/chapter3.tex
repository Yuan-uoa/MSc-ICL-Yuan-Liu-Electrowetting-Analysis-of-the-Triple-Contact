\chapter{Mapping of 90Â° Contact Angle Droplets}

This chapter reconstructs a charged droplet situated on an electrically negligible layer, with a 90$\degree$ contact angle. The process uncovers that the Crowdy map contains analytical solutions for droplets on a charged substrate along with interesting equipotential patterns.
