\section{Summary}
This chapter discusses the boundary equation of a charged droplet with a 90$\degree$ contact angle. Using mechanical methods, the divergence theorem, and the variational method, the Bernoulli condition of the droplet curve is derived. 

Through the Crowdy map, the entire boundary of the droplet, including both the upper boundary and the contact line between the droplet and the substrate upon which it rests, is accurately plotted. In achieving this, we aimed to determine the complex potential of this scenario. However, this attempt eventually proved unsuccessful.

Nevertheless, another reasonable finding was made: the Crowdy map contains the complex potential function for a droplet on a conducting plate, with an induced charge located above the droplet. This phenomenon may resemble the vortices that occur when flow passes over a convex surface under certain conditions.
